# Local inconsistency detection using the Kullback-Leibler divergence measure

## Description of the repository

The repository offers the typical structure of separate folders for R (scripts to replicate the main and supplementary Figures) and output (file _Figures_). 
* Each R script indicates which Figure it produces (one Figure only)
* The dataset for the first network can be found in the R folder under Thrombolytics_Dias_dataset.RData.

After downloading/cloning the repo, the user can use the .Rproj file to source all code.
